# Hide-and-seek
To run the project, you need to interpret the 'main.py' file. 
    Once you open the game's menu GUI, you can choose a map from the available maps in the map folder or browse to the map's directory path. 
    Choose a level to play along with the speed (1-10). 
    Keep in mind that the higher the speed, the harder it will be to observe the seeker's movement. 

When the game ends, the end menu GUI will appear, and you'll have the option to play that map with the chosen level again or 
    go back to the game's menu to choose another map along with the level and speed. If you turn off the menu without making a choice, 
    the game's menu will toggle.
